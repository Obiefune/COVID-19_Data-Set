# Dataset Description üìäüåç

This dataset contains global data on COVID-19-related mortality, including both confirmed deaths and excess mortality figures. It is sourced from official health organizations and aims to provide a detailed picture of the pandemic's impact on public health.

## Key Data Points:

1. Confirmed Deaths: Official count of deaths directly attributed to COVID-19, based on reported cases.
2. Excess Mortality: Total deaths above what would be expected under normal conditions. This includes both confirmed and unreported COVID-19 deaths, as well as deaths indirectly caused by the pandemic (e.g., disruptions in healthcare, lockdown effects, etc.).
3. Geographic Information: Mortality data is broken down by country, region, and sometimes by specific periods, allowing for regional comparisons and trends.
4. Time Period: Data spans the global pandemic, with time series data capturing mortality trends over months and years.

## Limitations ‚ö†Ô∏è:

1. Underreporting: Official death counts are likely underreported due to limited testing, inconsistent death registries, and challenges in determining the cause of death.
2. Data Quality: Variations in data collection methods across different regions may impact the accuracy and comparability of the numbers.
3. Excess Mortality: The excess mortality figure aims to account for the indirect impact of the pandemic, though it is subject to regional differences in reporting and healthcare disruptions.

## Purpose üßê:

This dataset is designed to offer a comprehensive overview of the COVID-19 mortality crisis, going beyond reported deaths to explore the broader impacts of the pandemic. It serves as a resource for analyzing trends, comparing regions, and understanding the full scale of the crisis.
